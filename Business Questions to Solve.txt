Business Questions to Solve

Customer Segmentation & Profiling
1. Which customer segments are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit?
    By age, job, marital status, or education level.
    Identify high-conversion personas (e.g., "single graduates aged 30–40 in management").
2. Does financial background (e.g., balance, loan status) affect subscription likelihood?
    Are customers with higher average balances more likely to subscribe?
    What’s the trend among those with housing or personal loans?

Campaign Strategy & Contact Effectiveness
3. What is the most effective contact communication type (cellular vs telephone)?
4. Which months have the highest subscription success rates?
    Are some months or seasons better for running campaigns?
5. How does the number of contacts (`campaign`) impact conversion?
    Is there a point where more calls reduce effectiveness? (e.g., over-contacting leads to rejection)
6. Does previous contact outcome influence current campaign success?
    How much more likely are clients to subscribe if they had a `poutcome = success`?

Timing & Behavior Analysis
7. Is call duration an indicator of success?
    Do longer conversations correlate with higher subscription rates?
   > Note: Don't use this in prediction due to leakage, but it's valuable insight for campaign planning.
8. Are clients contacted for the first time (`pdays = -1`) more or less likely to subscribe than those re-contacted?

Psychographic Insights & Risk Analysis
9. Do customers with `default = yes` or loans exhibit lower trust or interest in term deposits?
10. Are there demographic groups (e.g., retirees, students) that show unusual behavior or outliers in success rates?

Operational Questions
11. How can we optimize the number of contacts to balance cost and conversions?
 Ideal campaign length for high ROI.
12. Which customer attributes should the bank prioritize for lead scoring and targeting in future campaigns?
 Develop a data-driven customer targeting strategy.
